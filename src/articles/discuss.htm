    <p>When everything is fixed according to the photo, you might want to mark the issue as fixed. See the  <a href="mark-fixed.htm">Mark Photo as Fixed</a> article to learn how to do this.</p>
    <p>But before a photo is resolved / fixed, have a look at the <a href="inspo.htm">Inspo</a> section. You will definitely find some materials, furniture, equipment, etc., relevant to the fixlist topic / object.</p>
