<div class="article__content">
    <p>Usually, when we are going to fix something, we discuss the fixing process, the desired result, materials, etc. And,
        sometimes, we are stuck and lack of fantasy, so we need inspiration or an advice. Fixlist will take care of this
        - it provides a special unrivalled feature: the
        <b>Inspo</b>.</p>
    <p>At the bottom panel tap the
        <img src="../assets/images/icons/inspo-btn.png" alt="Inspo" class="icon l"> button:</p>

            <img src="../assets/images/screenshots/IMG_12014.png" alt="" class="screen inline">
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>You will get to the
        <b>Inspo</b> page. The page shows products from various manufacturers and online-stores. Every product is represented
        by its photo, name and short description. If you tap a product's photo, the browser on your device will open the
        corresponding web-page. There you can learn more about its price, attributes, etc. </p>
    <h2>What's so special?</h2>

    <p class="note">The Inspo list is based on your fixlists info. It searches the Internet for relevant goods only. Unlike commercials in
        other apps or on the web, Inspo gently gathers information about your fixlists, categorizes it and provides you with
        what you might be looking for. </p>
