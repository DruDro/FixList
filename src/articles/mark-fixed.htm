<div class="article__content">
    <p>When everything is done with a particular issue, all fixes are made, in order to distinguish open and fixed issue, you
        might want to mark the issue as fixed somehow.</p>
    <p>For this, every item in a fixlist has a special tick
        <img src="../assets/images/icons/fix-item.png" alt="Not fixed" class="icon m">:</p>
    <p class="center">
        <a href="../assets/images/screenshots/fix-item.png" data-fancybox="screenshots" data-caption="Fix item">
            <img src="../assets/images/screenshots/fix-item.png" alt="" class="screen inline">
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>To mark an item as fixed,
        <b>tap this tick</b>. It becomes filled with green:</p>
    <p class="center">
        <a href="../assets/images/screenshots/fix-item-fixed.png" data-fancybox="screenshots" data-caption="Fixed item">
            <img src="../assets/images/screenshots/fix-item-fixed.png" alt="" class="screen inline">
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>Now, on the Home screen, you won't see this item within the active fixlist. Instead, it will be displayed on the
        <b>Archive</b> tab of the Home screen:</p>
    <p class="center">

        <a href="../assets/images/screenshots/IMG_1225.png" data-fancybox="screenshots" data-caption="Home screen / Archive - fixed photos are displayed here">
            <img src="../assets/images/screenshots/IMG_1225.png" alt="" class="screen inline">
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>So you can manage items in fixlists and keep your fixing history.</p>
    <p>If an issue needs to be improved, re-fixed, etc., you can tap the tick again in the <b>Archive</b>, so that item appears back in the <b>Active</b> list.</p>
    <div class="note">
        <h2>Delete an item</h2>
        <p>As an alternative, you can delete items from fixlists. For this, from the
            <b>Active tab</b> of the current fixlist, tap the
            <img src="../assets/images/icons/photo-menu.png" alt="" class="icon s"> button under the item you want to delete:</p>
        <p class="center">

            <a href="../assets/images/screenshots/IMG_12261.png" data-fancybox="screenshots" data-caption="Home screen / Active - Calling Item Menu">
                <img src="../assets/images/screenshots/IMG_12261.png" alt="" class="screen inline">
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>In the appeared menu, select
            <b>Delete</b>:</p>
        <p class="center">
            <a href="../assets/images/screenshots/IMG_1229.png" data-fancybox="screenshots" data-caption="Share a photo">
                <img src="../assets/images/screenshots/IMG_1229.png" alt="" class="screen inline">
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>The item is deleted from the fixlist now, as well as all the information related to it: chat, fixing history, Inspo
            attachments, etc.</p>
        <p>It is highly recommended not to delete items from fixlists. They won&apos;t bother you from the
            <b>archive</b> if you just mark them as fixed.</p>
